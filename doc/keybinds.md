`<leader>` 		Indicates the leader key (Default: Space)
`<leader>f` 	Indicates the leader key plus f (Think Space-f)
`<leader>f` 	Indicates the leader key plus capital F (Think Space-Shift-f)

#### Special Key Names
`<CR>` 		Is equivalent to Enter/Return
`<BS>` 		Is equivalent to Backspace
`<Mouse1>`	Left Mouse Button
`<Mouse2>`	Right Mouse Button
`<VimKeys>` 	Is equivalent to the h,j,k,l navigation keys (also equivalent to the arrow keys)
