Nii-nvim is a very minimal neovim configuration focused on creating a functional
editor with a minimal amount of code. Nii-nvim also keeps the user in mind by
being very extensible and well documented. Nii-nvim is finally out of heavy
development, thus the project should be considered *mostly stable*

## Why nii-nvim? 

There are many neovim configurations that exist (i.e. NvChad, Lunar Vim,
SpaceVim, etc.), however, many of these configurations suffer from a host of
problems.
 - Some configurations (like NvChad), have very abstracted and complex
   codebases.
 - Others rely on having as much overall functionality as possible (like
   LunarVim).

While none of this is bad, there are some problems that can arise from these
choices:
 - Complex codebases lead to less freedom for end-user extensibility and
   configuration, as there is more reliance on the maintainer of said code.
 - Users may not use half of what is made available to them simply because they
   don't need all of that functionality, so all of it may not be necessary.

nii-nvim provides a solution to these problems by providing only the necessary
code in order to make a functioning configuration. The end goal of nii-nvim is
to be used as a base config for users to extend and add upon, leading to a more
unique editing experience.

Also the name is cute. 	(・3・)
